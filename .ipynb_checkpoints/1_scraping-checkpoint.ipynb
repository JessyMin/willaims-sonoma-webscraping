My biggest plus is getting the most of my tea variations by steeping it for the right amount of time and temperature. I can set it and walk away. Before i had to set an alarm and wait around till it was ready, well i'd always be caught up with something else and come to burnt tea or over steeped tea that was cold. I had been eyeing this product for over 6 years and never pulled the trigger, now i'm thinking, why did i wait this long??\n",

      "I happen to love the Breville tea maker. It just makes me happy to have a perfect cup of tea brewed at the right temp. It makes a difference then just trying to wing it with a standard tea kettle. I find it easy to clean with some soapy dish washing liquid and bam your done. I have had mine for over a year and I drink tea daily. It's my little peace of happiness next to my coffee maker. #smallthingsmakeyouhappy\n",

They need a major upgrade. When I read reviews prior to requesting as a Xmas gift, I noticed many people said their tea maker started to malfunction after a year. I thought I would be a lucky one and mine would last forever or at least the warranty would help. To fix it would mean a new kettle and it is as much as the tea maker. Shame on you Brevelle!\n",
